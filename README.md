# Writing READMEs Course Notes

My notes for the Udacity course on "Writing READMEs".

## Description

Udacity offers a brief, free course on documenting your code projects. I took the course, completed the exercises and took notes along the way. You'll find those notes here.

## Getting Started and Following Along

Here are some steps for using these notes alongside the class:
1. sign up for or log in to Udacity
2. enroll in the course at https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777
3. bring up my notes in `notes.md` and follow along

The first-level header in my notes matches the course title. Each of my second-level headers is marked with the name and number matching a section in the course, from 1 to 14.

## Motivation

I decided to take this course after a recommendation from an instructor in another Udacity course, I believe during the React Nanodegree program. This one is short, probably the shortest Udacity course I've taken, but what would a repo about course about writing READMEs be without a README?

## Do I recommend the course?

It depends. Are you new to Markdown and have you only ever reactively thrown together README files after your projects go live? It might be for you. Have you put thought into how to structure READMEs, studied other people's documentation and got even a slippery grasp on how to write your own? In that case, most of what you'll learn here (plus more) could be learned by taking time to reflect, compare and dig deeper into the layout and reasoning behind good vs mediocre READMEs.
