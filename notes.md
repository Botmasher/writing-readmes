# Writing READMEs

## 1. Welcome
- instructor: Walter
- compared to other things been doing with code docs seem stale
- it's not stale!
- cook up own READMEs
	- what documentation is
	- why it's important
	- incorporate into future projects
- this course is for you if:
	1. you write code
	2. you work with people who write code
- focus on the concepts not the code we'll document in this course

## 2. What Is Documentation?
- imagine a cookbook
	- documents what it takes to make delicious meals
	- might have all ingredients but it tells you how to put them together
- similar with code since documentation helps us understand other people's code
- instructor writes docs for all projects including [this course](https://github.com/udacity/ud777-writing-readmes)

## 3. Quiz: Who Is Documentation For?
- technical documentation often "written in plain English"
- written for humans
- written to make sense of code
- for OSS it's important since it helps gain users and contributors
- good documentation: people may want to use the code in their projects
- great documentation: people may want to contribute to your lib
- consider yourself, your coworkers, your users when you write

## 4. How Does Nijia Consume Documentation?
- use it to understand third-party libs and tools
- to get started running by looking for examples
- sad if documentation unavailable
	- not use lib
	- switch to lib with better doc
- how to figure out code when doc missing
	- dig through source code
	- examine with debugger
	- more advanced troubleshooting tools
	- it's "like reverse engineering somebody else's thought process"

## 5. Why Should Art Have Documented His Code?
- put a placeholder number and forgot to add to the README this was just a placeholder
- somebody called the number
- take a look at your older projects: what were you thinking?

## 6. Quiz: Introduction to READMEs
- sometimes docs can be overkill, like a cookbook for a single recipe
- README file is great for small projects
	- since the punchcard days
	- info about other files in the dir
	- usually in all caps to stand out
- check out these three READMEs:
	- What info do the above files have?
	- How is this info structured?
	- Are there patterns across the files?
	1. https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot
		- many headers
		- clearly defined
		- links
		- how to get started
		- how to contribute
		- at bottom, licensing info and links
	2. https://github.com/zkat/can.viewify
		- by instructor's friend
		- shorter but still clear sections
		- installation
		- description
		- usage examples
		- section with an issue in the code
		- licensing
	3. https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure
		- from Udacity's Git and GitHub course
		- not much info
		- but lots of details on how to contribute
		- licensing
	- all three contain "the essential information" to get things up and running
